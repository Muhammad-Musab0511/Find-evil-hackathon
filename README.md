Valhuntir turns a single incident response analyst into the manager of an agentic AI incident response team. A host of MCP tools allows the AI to quickly ingest, process, and analyze massive amounts of digital forensic artifacts while keeping the human in control of the investigation and decision making process. Curated forensic knowledge bases, guidance and context hints, and processing suggestions are built into the system, but ultimately the human examiner drives the response.

## Valhuntir — AI-Assisted Forensic Investigation

Valhuntir ensures accountability and enforces human review of findings through cryptographic signing, password-gated approvals, and multiple layered controls.

Valhuntir is **LLM client agnostic** — connect any locally installed MCP-compatible client through the gateway. Supported clients include Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cherry Studio, self-hosted LibreChat, and any client that supports Streamable HTTP transport with Bearer token authentication. The client must run on your machine or local network — cloud-hosted services cannot reach internal gateway addresses. Forensic discipline is provided structurally at the gateway and MCP layer, not through client-specific prompt engineering, so the same rigor applies regardless of which AI model or client drives the investigation.

> Looking for a simpler setup without the gateway or OpenSearch? See [Valhuntir Lite](#valhuntir-lite).

### Evidence Indexing with OpenSearch (Optional)

With [opensearch-mcp](https://github.com/AppliedIR/opensearch-mcp), evidence is parsed programmatically and indexed into OpenSearch, giving the LLM 17 purpose-built query tools instead of consuming billions of tokens reading raw artifacts. A 30-host triage collection with 50 million records becomes instantly searchable. Triage baseline and threat intelligence enrichment run programmatically — zero LLM tokens consumed.

15 parsers cover the forensic evidence spectrum: Windows Event Logs (evtx), 10 EZ Tool artifact types (Shimcache, Amcache, MFT, USN, Registry, Shellbags, Jumplists, LNK, Recyclebin, Timeline), Volatility 3 memory forensics, JSON/JSONL (Suricata, tshark, Velociraptor), delimited (CSV, TSV, Zeek, bodyfile, supertimelines), Apache/Nginx access logs, W3C (IIS, HTTPERR, Windows Firewall), Windows Defender MPLog, Scheduled Tasks XML, Windows Error Reporting, SSH auth logs, PowerShell transcripts, and Prefetch/SRUM (via Plaso or wintools-mcp).

Every parser produces deterministic content-based document IDs (re-ingest = zero duplicates), full provenance (`host.name`, `vhir.source_file`, `vhir.ingest_audit_id`), and proper `@timestamp` with timezone handling. Hayabusa auto-detection runs after EVTX ingest, applying 3,700+ Sigma rules and indexing alerts for structured querying.

### Investigation Workflow

1. **Create a case** — set case name, examiner identity, case directory
2. **Register evidence** — hash files, establish chain of custody
3. **Ingest and index** — parse evidence into OpenSearch for structured querying (or analyze files directly without OpenSearch)
4. **Scope the investigation** — review what's indexed, identify hosts and artifact types, check for Hayabusa detection alerts
5. **Enrich programmatically** — validate files/services against known-good baselines, check IOCs against threat intelligence (zero LLM tokens with opensearch-mcp)
6. **Search and analyze** — query across millions of records, aggregate patterns, build timelines
7. **Record findings** — LLM stages findings and timeline events as DRAFT with full evidence provenance
8. **Human review** — examiner approves or rejects each finding via the Examiner Portal or CLI (HMAC-signed)
9. **Generate report** — produce IR report from approved findings with MITRE mappings and IOC aggregation

Without OpenSearch, steps 3-6 are replaced by the LLM doing direct tool execution and analysis. Still very effective, but slower and with much higher token cost. Findings, timeline, approval workflow, and reporting are identical either way.

## Platform Architecture

The examiner interacts with Valhuntir through three interfaces: the **LLM client** (AI-assisted investigation), the **Examiner Portal** (browser-based review and approval), and the **vhir CLI** (case management, evidence handling, and verification).

### Deployment Overview

The typical deployment runs three VMs on a single host: SIFT (primary workstation), REMnux (malware analysis), and Windows (forensic tool execution). The examiner works on the SIFT VM — running the LLM client, the Examiner Portal in a browser, and the vhir CLI. REMnux and Windows are headless worker VMs. All three communicate over a VM-local network. Internet access is through NAT for external MCP services.

REMnux, Windows, and OpenSearch are optional. SIFT alone provides 73 MCP tools across 7 backends (90 with opensearch-mcp, 100 with wintools-mcp), the Examiner Portal, and full case management.

### SIFT Platform Components

The sift-gateway aggregates up to 8 MCP backends as stdio subprocesses behind a single HTTP endpoint. Each backend is also available individually. The Examiner Portal is served by the gateway for browser-based review and approval. opensearch-mcp connects to a local or remote OpenSearch instance for evidence indexing and querying at scale.

### Human-in-the-Loop Workflow

All findings and timeline events are staged as DRAFT by the AI. Only a human examiner can approve or reject them — via the Examiner Portal (browser) or the vhir CLI. Both paths produce identical HMAC-signed approval records. The AI cannot approve its own findings. MCP guidance provides reminders to the LLM to check in with the human frequently for review and guidance.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant AI as LLM + MCP Tools
    participant Case as Case Directory
    participant Human as Examiner<br/>(Portal or CLI)

    AI->>Case: record_finding() → DRAFT
    AI->>Case: record_timeline_event() → DRAFT
    Note over Case: Staged for review

    Human->>Case: Review, edit, approve/reject
    Human->>Case: Commit (password + HMAC signing)

    Note over Case: Only APPROVED items<br/>appear in reports
    Human->>Case: vhir report --full
```

The **Examiner Portal** (`vhir portal`) is the primary review interface — an 8-tab browser UI where examiners review, edit, approve, and reject findings and timeline events. The Commit button requires the examiner's password. The CLI's `vhir approve` provides the same capability from the terminal.

Examiners review findings in the Examiner Portal — validating artifacts, observations, and interpretations, with the full command audit trail from original evidence to final result.

![Examiner Portal — Findings](docs/images/portal-findings.png)

The timeline view places findings and other observables in chronological context across the investigation.

### Forensic Knowledge Reinforcement

Valhuntir reinforces forensic discipline through multiple layers built into the MCP servers, client configuration, and gateway — not through a single system prompt that the LLM can drift from during long sessions.

- **Forensic Knowledge (FK) package** — When a forensic tool is executed, the response is enriched with tool-specific caveats, corroboration suggestions, and field interpretation guidance. Delivered at the MCP response level, not in the system prompt, so it arrives exactly when the LLM needs it.
- **Discipline reminders** — Each tool response includes a rotating forensic methodology reminder. Finding validation checks submissions against methodology standards and returns actionable feedback.
- **MCP server instructions** — Each backend provides structured instructions during session initialization. The gateway aggregates them into a single coherent briefing.
- **Client configuration** — For Claude Code, `vhir setup client` deploys forensic discipline docs, investigation rules, and tool reference guides as persistent context. Other clients receive guidance through MCP server instructions.
- **Forensic RAG** — Semantic search across 22,000+ records from 23 authoritative sources (Sigma, MITRE ATT&CK, LOLBAS, Atomic Red Team, and more). Grounds LLM analysis in authoritative references rather than training data.
- **Windows triage baseline** — Offline validation against 2.6 million known-good records. No network calls required.

These layers reinforce each other through consistent, contextual repetition across all interaction surfaces. See the [Architecture documentation](https://appliedir.github.io/Valhuntir/architecture/) for full details.

### External Dependencies

- **Zeltser IR Writing MCP** — Required for report generation. Configured automatically by `vhir setup client`. URL: https://website-mcp.zeltser.com/mcp (HTTPS, no auth)

## Quick Start

### SIFT Workstation

Requires Python 3.10+ and sudo access. The installer handles everything: MCP servers, gateway, vhir CLI, HMAC verification ledger, examiner identity, and LLM client configuration. When you select Claude Code, additional forensic controls are deployed (kernel-level sandbox, case data deny rules, PreToolUse guard hook, PostToolUse audit hook, provenance enforcement, password-gated human approval with HMAC signing). Other clients get MCP config only.

**Quick** — Core platform only, no databases (~70 MB):

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AppliedIR/sift-mcp/main/quickstart.sh -o /tmp/vhir-quickstart.sh && bash /tmp/vhir-quickstart.sh
```

**Recommended** — Adds the RAG knowledge base (22,000+ records from 23 authoritative sources) and Windows triage databases (2.6M baseline records), downloaded as pre-built snapshots. Requires ~14 GB disk space:

- ~7 GB — ML dependencies (PyTorch, CUDA) required by the RAG embedding model
- ~6 GB — Windows triage baseline databases (2.6M rows, decompressed)
- ~1 GB — RAG index, source code, and everything else

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AppliedIR/sift-mcp/main/quickstart.sh -o /tmp/vhir-quickstart.sh && bash /tmp/vhir-quickstart.sh --recommended
```

**Recommended with OpenSearch** — Everything above plus evidence indexing at scale. Parses and indexes evidence into OpenSearch, giving the LLM 17 structured query tools instead of reading raw artifacts. Requires Docker.

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AppliedIR/sift-mcp/main/quickstart.sh -o /tmp/vhir-quickstart.sh && bash /tmp/vhir-quickstart.sh --recommended --opensearch
```

**Custom** — Individual package selection, OpenCTI integration, or remote access with TLS:

```
git clone https://github.com/AppliedIR/sift-mcp.git && cd sift-mcp
./setup-sift.sh
```

### Windows Forensic Workstation (optional)

```
# Option 1: git clone
git clone https://github.com/AppliedIR/wintools-mcp.git; cd wintools-mcp

# Option 2: download ZIP (no git required)
Invoke-WebRequest https://github.com/AppliedIR/wintools-mcp/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -OutFile wintools.zip
Expand-Archive wintools.zip -DestinationPath .; cd wintools-mcp-main
```

Then run the installer:

```
.\scripts\setup-windows.ps1
```

## Security Considerations

All Valhuntir components are assumed to run on a private forensic network, protected by firewalls, and not exposed to incoming connections from the Internet or potentially hostile systems. The design assumes dedicated, isolated systems are used throughout.

Any data loaded into the system or its component VMs, computers, or instances runs the risk of being exposed to the underlying AI. Only place data on these systems that you are willing to send to your AI provider.

Outgoing Internet connections are required for report generation (Zeltser IR Writing MCP) and optionally used for threat intelligence (OpenCTI) and documentation (MS Learn MCP). No incoming connections from external systems should be allowed.

Valhuntir is designed so that AI interactions flow through MCP tools, enabling security controls and audit trails. Clients with direct shell access (like Claude Code) get additional forensic controls deployed by `vhir setup client` — sandbox, deny rules, audit hooks, and provenance enforcement. The password-gated approval system (HMAC-signed) is the primary security control and applies to all clients. Valhuntir is not designed to defend against a malicious AI or to constrain the AI client that you deploy. See the [Security Model](https://appliedir.github.io/Valhuntir/security/) for details.

## Commands

Most `vhir` CLI operations have MCP equivalents via case-mcp, forensic-mcp, and report-mcp. When working with an MCP-connected client, you can ask the AI to handle case management, evidence registration, report generation, and more — the AI operates through audited MCP tools rather than direct CLI invocation.

The commands below require the examiner's password and are intentional human-in-the-loop checkpoints. The password is the security gate — without it, no findings can be approved or rejected regardless of the client or access method.

### Human-Only Commands (require password)

These commands require password entry that the AI cannot supply. This is by design — the examiner must authenticate to approve, reject, or commit findings.

#### approve

```
vhir approve                                             # Interactive review of all DRAFT items
vhir approve F-alice-001 F-alice-002 T-alice-001         # Approve specific IDs
vhir approve F-alice-001 --edit                          # Edit in $EDITOR before approving
vhir approve F-alice-001 --note "Malware family unconfirmed"  # Approve with examiner note
vhir approve --by jane                                   # Filter to IDs with jane's examiner prefix
vhir approve --findings-only                             # Skip timeline events
vhir approve --timeline-only                             # Skip findings
vhir approve --review                                    # Apply pending portal edits
```

Requires the examiner's password. Approved findings are HMAC-signed with a PBKDF2-derived key. The `--review` flag applies edits made in the Examiner Portal (stored in `pending-reviews.json`), recomputes content hashes and HMAC signatures, then removes the pending file. Alternatively, use the portal's Commit button (Shift+C) which performs the same operation via challenge-response authentication — the password never leaves the browser.

#### reject

```
vhir reject F-alice-003 --reason "Insufficient evidence for attribution"
vhir reject F-alice-003 T-alice-002 --reason "Contradicted by memory analysis"
vhir reject --review                                     # Interactive walk-through of DRAFT items
```

Requires the examiner's password.

#### exec

```
vhir exec --purpose "Extract MFT from image" -- fls -r -m / image.E01
```

Requires terminal confirmation. Logged to `audit/cli-exec.jsonl`. Use this for manual tool execution with audit trail when not operating through MCP.

#### evidence unlock

```
vhir unlock-evidence                       # Directory chmod 755, files remain 444
vhir evidence unlock
```

Requires terminal confirmation. Unlocking evidence allows writes to the evidence directory.

#### Password management

```
vhir config --setup-password               # Set approval password (PBKDF2-hashed, min 8 chars)
vhir config --reset-password               # Reset password (requires current, re-signs ledger)
```

Password entry uses masked input. The AI cannot supply the password.

#### HMAC verification

```
vhir review --verify                       # Cross-check content hashes + HMAC verification
vhir review --verify --mine                # HMAC verification for current examiner only
```

Requires the examiner's password to derive the HMAC key and confirm integrity. `--verify` also works with `--findings` (`vhir review --findings --verify`).

### All Commands

The remaining commands can also be performed through MCP tools (case-mcp, forensic-mcp, report-mcp) when working with an MCP-connected client. The CLI equivalents are listed here for reference and for use outside MCP sessions.

#### portal

```
vhir portal                                              # Open the Examiner Portal in your browser
```

Opens the Examiner Portal for the active case. The portal is the primary review interface — examiners can review, edit, approve, reject, and commit findings entirely in the browser. The Commit button (Shift+C) requires the examiner's password. Alternatively, `vhir approve --review` applies pending edits from the CLI.

#### backup

```
vhir backup /path/to/destination                         # Back up case data (interactive)
vhir backup /path/to/destination --all                   # Evidence + extractions + OpenSearch
vhir backup /path/to/destination --include-opensearch    # Include OpenSearch indices
vhir backup /path/to/destination --include-evidence      # Include evidence files
vhir backup /path/to/destination --include-extractions   # Include extraction files
vhir backup --verify /path/to/backup/                    # Verify backup integrity
```

Creates a timestamped backup with SHA-256 manifest. Password hash files are always included for HMAC verification. The `--all` flag includes evidence, extractions, and OpenSearch indices (if available). Without flags, interactive mode prompts per category with size estimates.

#### restore

```
vhir restore /path/to/backup/INC-2026-0411-2026-04-13   # Restore from backup
vhir restore /path/to/backup/... --skip-opensearch       # Skip OpenSearch restore
vhir restore /path/to/backup/... --skip-ledger           # Skip verification ledger
```

Restores a case from backup to its original path. Includes case files, verification ledger, password hashes, and OpenSearch indices (if present in backup). Prompts for the examiner password to verify HMAC integrity. Never auto-activates — run `vhir case activate` after restore.

#### case

```
vhir case init                                           # Interactive — prompts for name, ID, directory
vhir case init "Ransomware Investigation"                # Create with name, auto-generated ID
vhir case init "Investigation" --case-id INC-2026-001    # Create with custom case ID
vhir case activate INC-2026-02191200                     # Set active case
vhir case close INC-2026-02191200                        # Close a case by ID
vhir case reopen INC-2026-02191200                       # Reopen a closed case

vhir case migrate --import-all                         # Merge all examiners' data
```

#### config

```
vhir config --examiner "jane-doe"          # Set examiner identity
vhir config --show                         # Show current configuration
```

#### update

```
vhir update                       # Pull latest, reinstall, redeploy, restart
vhir update --check               # Check for updates without applying
vhir update --no-restart          # Skip gateway restart after update
```

#### join

```
vhir join --sift SIFT_URL --code CODE                            # Join from remote machine using join code
vhir join --sift SIFT_URL --code CODE --wintools                 # Join as wintools machine (registers backend)
```

Exchange a one-time join code for gateway credentials. Run on the remote machine (analyst laptop or Windows forensic workstation). The join code is generated on SIFT via `vhir setup join-code`. Credentials are saved to `~/.vhir/config.yaml` with restricted permissions (0600).

#### setup

```
vhir setup client                          # Interactive client configuration (recommended)
vhir setup test                            # Test MCP server connectivity
```

#### setup client

Generate Streamable HTTP config for your LLM client:

```
vhir setup client                                                          # Interactive wizard
vhir setup client --client=claude-code --sift=http://127.0.0.1:4508 -y    # Local solo
vhir setup client --sift=SIFT_IP:4508 --windows=WIN_IP:4624               # SIFT + Windows
```

For remote orchestrator setups (Path 2), remote examiners run a platform-specific setup script that creates a `~/vhir/` workspace with MCP config, forensic controls, and discipline docs:

```
# Linux
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AppliedIR/Valhuntir/main/setup-client-linux.sh \
  | bash -s -- --sift=https://SIFT_IP:4508 --code=XXXX-XXXX

# macOS
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AppliedIR/Valhuntir/main/setup-client-macos.sh \
  | bash -s -- --sift=https://SIFT_IP:4508 --code=XXXX-XXXX
```

```
# Windows
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AppliedIR/Valhuntir/main/setup-client-windows.ps1 -OutFile setup-client-windows.ps1
.\setup-client-windows.ps1 -Sift https://SIFT_IP:4508 -Code XXXX-XXXX
```

Always launch your LLM client from `~/vhir/` or a subdirectory. Forensic controls only apply when started from within the workspace. To uninstall, re-run the setup script with `--uninstall` (Linux/macOS) or `-Uninstall` (Windows).

Claude Desktop's config file supports stdio transport only. The [mcp-remote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) bridge is used to connect to the gateway. `vhir setup client --client=claude-desktop` generates the correct mcp-remote config automatically.

| Client | Platforms | Config file | Extras |
|--------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Claude Code | Linux, macOS, Windows | `~/vhir/.mcp.json` or `~/.claude.json` (SIFT) | `CLAUDE.md`, `settings.json`, sandbox, audit hooks |
| Claude Desktop | macOS, Windows | `claude_desktop_config.json` (see note) | Requires mcp-remote bridge. Project instructions from AGENTS.md |
| Cherry Studio | Linux, macOS, Windows | JSON import (manual) | `baseUrl` field, `streamableHttp` type (camelCase) |
| LibreChat | Any (browser) | `librechat.yaml` (`mcpServers` section) | Valhuntir generates `librechat_mcp.yaml` reference to merge |
| Other | Any | `vhir-mcp-config.json` | Manual integration |

Claude Code on Windows requires Git for Windows (provides Git Bash) or WSL. Claude Desktop is not available on Linux and requires the [mcp-remote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) bridge (stdio-only config). Config paths: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS), `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows). Any MCP client that supports Streamable HTTP transport with Bearer token authentication will work — the gateway is not client-specific.

## Examiner Identity

Every approval, rejection, and command execution is logged with examiner identity. Resolution order:

| Priority | Source | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | `--examiner` flag | `vhir approve --examiner jane-doe F-jane-001` |
| 2 | `VHIR_EXAMINER` env var | `export VHIR_EXAMINER=jane-doe` |
| 3 | `~/.vhir/config.yaml` | `examiner: jane-doe` |
| 4 | `VHIR_ANALYST` env var | Deprecated fallback |
| 5 | OS username | Warns if unconfigured |

## Operator environment variables (opensearch-mcp ingest resilience)

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `HAYABUSA_RULES_DIR` | *(autodetect)* | Path to hayabusa-rules directory (must contain a `config/` subdirectory). Set when hayabusa rules are installed outside the default locations (`/usr/local/share/hayabusa-rules`, `/usr/share/hayabusa-rules`, `/opt/hayabusa*/rules`). Example: `Environment=HAYABUSA_RULES_DIR=/srv/forensics/hayabusa-rules` in the gateway systemd unit file. |
| `VHIR_SHARD_BREAKER_THRESHOLD` | `3` | Consecutive shard-limit batch failures before the bulk-write circuit breaker halts ingest. |
| `VHIR_INTEL_BREAKER_THRESHOLD` | `10` | Consecutive non-rate-limit OpenCTI errors before enrichment halts. |
| `VHIR_INTEL_RATE_LIMIT_RETRIES` | `5` | Per-IOC retry cap when OpenCTI rate-limits. |
| `VHIR_INTEL_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` | `100` | Minimum milliseconds between OpenCTI requests (default ~10 QPS). Prevents self-inflicted rate limits. Clamped to a 10ms floor. |

All thresholds clamp to a sane lower bound (operator typo of `0` won't disable safety).

## Repo Map

| Repo | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [sift-mcp](https://github.com/AppliedIR/sift-mcp) | Monorepo: 11 SIFT packages (forensic-mcp, case-mcp, report-mcp, sift-mcp, sift-gateway, case-dashboard, forensic-knowledge, forensic-rag, windows-triage, opencti, sift-common) |
| [opensearch-mcp](https://github.com/AppliedIR/opensearch-mcp) | Evidence indexing + querying via OpenSearch (17 tools, 15 parsers). Optional. |
| [wintools-mcp](https://github.com/AppliedIR/wintools-mcp) | Windows forensic tool execution (10 tools, 31 catalog entries) |
| [Valhuntir](https://github.com/AppliedIR/Valhuntir) | CLI, architecture reference |

## Updating

### Valhuntir

```
vhir update              # Pull latest code, reinstall packages, redeploy controls, restart gateway
vhir update --check      # Check for updates without applying
vhir update --no-restart # Update without restarting the gateway
```

The update command pulls the latest code from all configured repos (sift-mcp, vhir,
opensearch-mcp, wintools-mcp), reinstalls all packages, redeploys forensic controls,
restarts the gateway, and runs a connectivity smoke test.

## Valhuntir Lite

In its simplest form, Valhuntir Lite provides Claude Code with forensic knowledge and instructions on how to enforce forensic rigor, present findings for human review, and audit actions taken. MCP servers enhance accuracy by providing authoritative information — a forensic knowledge RAG and a Windows triage database — plus optional OpenCTI threat intelligence and REMnux malware analysis.

**Quick** — Forensic discipline, MCP packages, and config. No databases (<70 MB):

```
git clone https://github.com/AppliedIR/sift-mcp.git
cd sift-mcp
./quickstart-lite.sh --quick
```

**Recommended** — Adds the RAG knowledge base (22,000+ records from 23 authoritative sources) and Windows triage databases (2.6M baseline records). Requires ~14 GB disk space:

- ~7 GB — ML dependencies (PyTorch, CUDA) required by the RAG embedding model
- ~6 GB — Windows triage baseline databases (2.6M rows, decompressed)
- ~1 GB — RAG index, source code, and everything else

```
git clone https://github.com/AppliedIR/sift-mcp.git
cd sift-mcp
./quickstart-lite.sh
```

This one-time setup takes approximately 15-30 minutes depending on
internet speed and CPU. Subsequent runs reuse existing databases and index.

```
claude
/welcome
```

To update an existing Valhuntir Lite installation, re-run the installer from an updated clone:

```
cd sift-mcp
git pull
./quickstart-lite.sh
```

The installer is idempotent — it reuses the existing venv, skips databases
and RAG index if already present, and redeploys config files.

| Connection | Protocol | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Claude Code → forensic-rag-mcp | stdio | Local Python process, always present |
| Claude Code → windows-triage-mcp | stdio | Local Python process, always present |
| Claude Code → opencti-mcp | stdio | Local Python process, connects out to OpenCTI via HTTP(S) |
| opencti-mcp → OpenCTI Instance | HTTP(S) | opencti-mcp runs locally, calls out to the OpenCTI server |
| Claude Code → remnux-mcp | streamable-http | Remote, on its own REMnux workstation |
| Claude Code → MS Learn MCP | HTTPS | `https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp` — streamable-http type in .mcp.json |
| Claude Code → Zeltser IR Writing MCP | HTTPS | `https://website-mcp.zeltser.com/mcp` — streamable-http type in .mcp.json |

No gateway, no sandbox, no deny rules. Claude runs forensic tools directly via Bash. Forensic discipline is suggested and reinforced via prompt hooks and reference documents, but Claude Code can choose to ignore them. See the [sift-mcp README](https://github.com/AppliedIR/sift-mcp#valhuntir-lite) for optional add-on install flags (`--opencti`, `--remnux`, `--mslearn`, `--zeltser`).

## Upgrading from Lite to Valhuntir

Both modes share the same Python venv, triage databases, and RAG index.
Valhuntir adds the gateway (up to 8 MCP backends behind one HTTP endpoint),
4+ additional MCP servers (forensic-mcp, case-mcp, report-mcp, sift-mcp,
and optionally opensearch-mcp), a web-based review portal (Examiner Portal),
structured case management, sandbox enforcement, and HMAC-signed approvals.

To upgrade, run `setup-sift.sh` from your existing sift-mcp clone. The
installer reuses the existing venv and databases. Lite case data (markdown
files) does not auto-migrate to Valhuntir case data (structured JSON) — start
fresh or transfer findings manually.

## Evidence Handling

Never place original evidence on any Valhuntir system. Only use working copies for which verified originals or backups exist. Valhuntir workstations process evidence through AI-connected tools, and any data loaded into these systems may be transmitted to the configured AI provider. Treat all Valhuntir systems as analysis environments, not evidence storage.

Evidence integrity is verified by SHA-256 hashes recorded at registration. Examiners can optionally lock evidence to read-only via `vhir evidence lock`. Proper evidence integrity depends on verified hashes, write blockers, and chain-of-custody procedures that exist outside this platform.

Case directories can reside on external or removable media. ext4 is preferred for full permission support. NTFS and exFAT are acceptable but file permission controls (read-only protection) will be silently ineffective. FAT32 is discouraged due to the 4 GB file size limit.

## Responsible Use and Legal

While steps have been taken to enforce human-in-the-loop controls, it is ultimately the responsibility of each examiner to ensure that their findings are accurate and complete. The AI, like a hex editor, is a tool to be used by properly trained incident response professionals. Users are responsible for ensuring their use complies with applicable laws, regulations, and organizational policies. Use only on systems and data you are authorized to analyze.

## Clear Disclosure

I do DFIR. I am not a developer. This project would not exist without Claude Code handling the implementation. While an immense amount of effort has gone into design, testing, and review, I fully acknowledge that I may have been working hard and not smart in places. My intent is to jumpstart discussion around ways this technology can be leveraged for efficiency in incident response while ensuring that the ultimate responsibility for accuracy remains with the human examiner.
